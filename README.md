# Graduate Handbook for Chemical Engineering

The handbook has been updated to a web-friendly format using [Typora](https://typora.io/). This allows for export to multiple formats, but primarily it provides a source code that is much easier to work with that a word processing document, and it can directly be exported to HTML and included in a website.

The current version is 2023_0.1.0, and it can be viewed in HTML format [here](https://docnathanm.github.io/chemeng_gradHandbook/).
