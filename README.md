# Graduate Handbook for Chemical Engineering

The handbook has been updated to a web-friendly format using [Typora](https://typora.io/). This allows for export to multiple formats, but primarily it provides a source code that is much easier to work with that a word processing document, and it can directly be exported to HTML and included in a website.

The HTML format for version 2023_0.1.0 can be viewed [here](https://docnathanm.github.io/chemeng_gradHandbook/).

The "home" for the official 2023_0.2.1 version in PDF format is on the University of Mississippi website: [chemical.olemiss.edu](https://chemical.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2021/10/Chemical-Engineering-Graduate-Student-Handbook.pdf).
